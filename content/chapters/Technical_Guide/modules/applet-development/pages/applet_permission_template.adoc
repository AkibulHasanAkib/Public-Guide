==Create Permission Templates 
* Firstly, a developer needs to identify the webservices according to the CRUD ( Create, Read, Update, Delete ) operations in an applet. To identify the webservices for the specific CRUD operation developer may use the source code or network tab in the browser's developer tools. We will be using browser's developer tools here.

* List down all the webservices for each CRUD operation separately. For example, to view the list of Internal Purchase Return Listing, these are the webservices have been used.

* Then, find the permission definitions for the listed web services. Developers use 'blg-akaun-platform-java' library to find the permission definitions. Every webservice has a controler.java file containing the permission definitions in the java library. There are permission definitions for GET, PUT, POST, DELETE operations and permissions for Admin, Owner and Users.
