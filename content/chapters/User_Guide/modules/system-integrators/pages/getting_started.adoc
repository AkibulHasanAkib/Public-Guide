*Notice*: AuthToken is refreshed every month, developers should get new authToken once every month(for testing api using authtoken**not applicable for etl endpoint).


Below is the method to get authToken using sandbox (development) environment as an example

* Login into https://akaun.dev
//
* Right click on an empty space and choose “Inspect”
//
* Find “Local Storage” under “Storage” tag

[#h4_understanding_triggers_and_web_hooks]
===== Understanding Triggers and Web hooks

When you are integrating with the Akaun Platform, instead of polling the APIs with repetitive schedulers, it is possible for the system integrators to be using Web Hooks for more efficient integrations.

// [#h5_webhooks]
*Webhooks*

// [#h6_briefing_on_webhook]
*a. Briefing on webhook*

Webhooks are used in BigLedger to allow external integrations to be called whenever a particular event occurs. Usually, the event is an API call received by BigLedger.

For any kind of event such as creating vouchers or creating Items:

* From BigLedger side, a topic of webhook is created +
* From external side, they will need to subscribe to those topics. And later when they do any operations like "create Item", the webhook will be triggered and they will get a response.
 

// [#h6_Webhook_topic_apis]
// =======Webhook Topics APIs

// [#h7_get_webhook_topics]
// ========GET Webhook Topics

// Webhook topics are created automatically when a new tenant is created.

// To get the all Webhook Topics, you can call GET api using Postman:

// *Url: /core2/tnt/dm/webhook-topic

// *Request Headers:

// **Authorization: {{authToken from website}}
// **Content-Type: application/json
// **tenantCode: {{tenant_code}}

// *Request Method: GET

// Sample Data

// |===
// | Guid |  Topic_Code 

// | 6dc08d0d-b125-4b41-8395-7f401b56908d		
// | COMPANY_CREATED

// [#h7_create_webhook_topic]
// ========CREATE Webhook Topic

// Notice: Webhook topics are defined by BigLedger backend team, please confirm webhook topic codes with @Ahmed Hassan before creating new API.

// *Url: /core2/tnt/dm/webhook-topic

// *Request Headers:

// **Authorization: {{authToken from website}}

// **Content-Type: application/json

// **tenantCode: {{tenant_code}}

// *Request Method: POST

// *Request body:

[#h4_virtual_etl_applet]
===== Virtual ETL Applet
Virtual Etl applet is an applet which for setting purpose including organization of the permission for etl APIs. Platform Sysadmin will be in charge of installing the the applet and granting necessary permission to access etl APIs.

Once the permission granted, the user may try to access the endpoint to ensure the permissions are successfully granted. The user also may visit this applet to see the list of permission being granted.
