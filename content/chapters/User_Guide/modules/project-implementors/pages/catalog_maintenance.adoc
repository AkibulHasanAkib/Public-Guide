= Applet-Catalog Maintenance

Applet-Catalog is a curated list of applets combined with a curated list of users with permissions to install these applets in the list. 
Users are able to open the Applet Store to see a list of Private Catalogs and install the applets accordingly.
Currently, only the Platform System Administrator is allowed to create the Applet-Catalogs, and add users to the 

When adding an applet to a catalog, the Platform System administrators get to specify the tenant, rank, edition and addons. While the tenant and rank options do not affect the subscription pricing, the edition and addons determines the monthly subscription fee of the applets. 

A tenant OWNER/ADMIN who happens to also be the ADMIN/OWNER of a Applet-Catalog is able to add/remove applets from the Applet-Catalog as well as adding or removing users from the Applet-Catalog. Typically, many catalogs would be created for the users of a tenant. In the example below, we make use of some fictitious company names for elaboration purpose.
