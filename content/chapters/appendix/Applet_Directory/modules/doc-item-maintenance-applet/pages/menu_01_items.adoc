The screenshot above shows the mandatory fields that the user has to fill (except description, as it is not mandatory). Once the item has been created more information can be added in the EDIT ITEM section. Only basic information is required to be filled in the CREATE section and afterwards users can continue editing items in order to add more information at any time. We exclude adding more information in the CREATE section because if there is a lot of information to be added the user might forget to click save. Adding as little information as possible in the CREATE section prevents and/or reduces data being lost.
