= 6.0 Applet Permission Settings

Generally, all applets in the Applet Store share some common features. One of the essential features is the permission setting for an applet. This is because a client who uses the applets may want to set specific permissions to regulate the access control of his employees in using the applets.

.Settings Tab
image::17. SettingsTab.png[align="center"]

Firstly, users can navigate to the “Settings” tab which is located at the bottom left of every opened applet as shown in the screenshot above to configure their applet settings.

== 6.1 Permission Set

A permission template is a template that consists of one or multiple permission lines. Every permission line refers to a specific defined permission. For example, permission to create internal sales order invoices. 

A permission set is a permission template in which the permission lines are configured to targets. The target can be a branch, company or location, depending on the permission template. By doing that, the targets are given permissions to perform certain operations.

Only users with the ADMIN or OWNER rank in the applet can have read and write access in assigning the permissions to the applet users. Users with MEMBER rank have only read access to the permissions settings in the applet.
