Users are *not allowed* to *edit* the *job shipments*, but are *given the option* to *cancel job shipments* instead as to avoid confusion in the final sum of the product shipped. 

This can be done by *clicking* on the *“Add to Trip”*, a *list of features* will then be *displayed* which includes “Printing”, “Canceling Jobs”. By *selecting* the *“Canceling Jobs”*, the *blue button* will be *changed* from *“Add”* to *“Cancel”*. Finally the user will need to *tick the box* to *select* the *jobs* as shown in the red box above. *Clicking* the *“Cancel”* button to *finish* the process. The *similar concept* applies to *Adding Trip*.
