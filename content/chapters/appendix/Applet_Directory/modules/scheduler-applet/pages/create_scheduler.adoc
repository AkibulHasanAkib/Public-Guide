.Create Scheduler: Cron Expression Tab
image::CreateScheduler-CronExpression.png[align="center"]

A *cron expression* is a string consisting of five or six subexpressions (fields) that describe individual details of the schedule. These fields, separated by white space, can contain any of the allowed values with various combinations of the allowed characters for that field.

Descriptions of allowed special characters:

*Asterisk* (*) indicates any value.

*Comma* (,) is a value list separator to mention different values. For example, using "MON,WED,FRI '' in the 5th field (day of the week) means Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays.

*Dash* (-) defines the range of values. For example, 2000–2010 indicates every year between 2000 and 2010, inclusive.

*Slash* (/) is used to specify step values. For example, */5 in the minutes field indicates every 5 minutes.
